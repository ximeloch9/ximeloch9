I am a highly skilled Test Automation Engineer with expertise in Serenity BDD, Cypress IO, JMeter, and Postman, focused on delivering high-quality software products through automation. With 5 years of experience in quality assurance under agile methodologies, I specialize in both functional and non-functional testing. I have held roles as Product Owner and Project Manager, leading multidisciplinary teams in strategic planning, risk management, and process optimization.
In addition to designing robust test automation scripts, I improve release cycle times by reducing regression testing and collaborating with QA Analysts and Software Developers. My experience extends to API automation, cloud device/browser providers, and incorporating automated suites into the pipeline. I thrive in agile environments, applying solid coding skills and a strategic mindset to drive efficiency, quality, and innovation.
